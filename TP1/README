Files architecture:
	graph.cpp: 
		reads the input file and creates a graph
	dijkstra.cpp:
		applies the shortest path algorithm to the given file

Graph implementation choices:
	1- Adjacency matrix:
	Matrix[n,n], if i is connected to j then M[i,j]=1
		bad idea, the matrix usually is pretty empty,
		so it requires way too much memory
	2- Adjacency list:
	Array[n], A[i] is a linked list of the neighbours
		good idea, but we're not going to modify the graph
		after its creation, which is the advantage of a list
	3- Adjacency arrays:
	Array[n], A[i] is an array of the neighbours
		even better, using an array makes the access easier
	4- Forward-star:
	same Array[n] nut only one Array[m] which is the "fusion" of
	the n previous arrays
		chosen solution
